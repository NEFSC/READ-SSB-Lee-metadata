Purpose: The Google Sheet is intended to share and store metadata on Social Sciences Branch (SSB) surveys, data, and collaborations which primarily focus on social, economic, and or socioeconomic information.

Goal: Increase transparency of all economic and socioeconomic efforts which the SSB is leading or has staff involved in and increase knowledge/ accessibility to the data sources and data summaries which are most likely not captured in other metadata sources (such as the data dictionary).
Contributing: Any member of the SSB is encouraged to update this sheet as survey or data efforts occur or as increased information is published around each effort.
