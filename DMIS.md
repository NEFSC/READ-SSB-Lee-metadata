The Data Matching and Imputation System is maintained by GARFO. Just email Michael Lanning at GARFO, he's got all the answers. j.michael.lanning@noaa.gov 

"Live" Tables: 

* APSD.t_ssb_trip_current@garfo_nefsc
* APSD.t_ssb_catch_current@garfo_nefsc 
* APSD.t_ssb_discard_current@garfo_nefsc

obsolete tables:
* APSD.t_ssb_trip@garfo_nefsc
* APSD.t_ssb_catch@garfo_nefsc 
* APSD.t_ssb_discard@garfo_nefsc

Location: GARFO super secret server (but really, @garfo_nefsc)

Schema: 

DMIS and AA are expected to be replaced by CAMS.

# Current Collection Methods

## GARFO provided metadata

Here are a few documents that describe DMIS.

1.  [DMIS Data Dictionary](/external/DMIS%20Data%20Dictionary%20(SSB).docx). Circulated by Tammy Murphy on April 27, 2020.
1.  [DMIS Data Dictionary part 2](/external/DMIS_Table_Dictionaries_July_2012.docx).  Circulated by Tammy Murphy on May 1, 2020. I'm not sure how this differs from the previous.
1.  [DMIS Documentation](/external/DMIS%20Documentation.pdf).   This appears to be from J. Michael Lanning and last modified on September 26, 2019.
1.  [DMIS and AA comparison](/external/NRCC-Report-Catch-Differences-180511-Lanning.pdf).   J. Michael Lanning's Presentation that describes AA and DMIS, given to [NRCC on May 15,2018](https://www.nefmc.org/calendar/may-15-16-2018-nrcc-meeting).
1.  [DMIS Binning Rules](/external/Groundfish%20Quota%20Monitoring%20Binning%20Rules_201223.docx) for the "fishery_group" column. 

Ben Galuardi has built a custom DMIS table that combines the surfclam data with the DMIS data. It runs from 2007 to present.  The code used to generate it is [here](/external/make_sfclam_only_013022.sql) and [here](/external/MAKE_DMIS_SFCLAM_122121.sql).  This DMIS table can be queried by:

```
select * from APSD.DMIS_WIND_TEST@garfo_nefsc
```
This table was constructed specifically to support the [offshoreWind](https://github.com/dcorvi/offshoreWind). It only has a subset of columns, but it retains linking variables additional data can easily be added to it.

# Tips and Tricks

## General Caveats


### Linking to Veslog

Linking to VESLOG with DMIS DOCID has a few issues. (Chad Demarest, May 14, 2020)
1.  JML adds digits to DMIS DOCID to denote subtrips.
1.  Another is that some data handling protocols (varies by file type) truncate a digit off the end of the EVTR serial numbers.
1.  A third is that DMIS will Give positive (mostly correct) matchâ€™s where the DOCID fails for these and other reasons.


As of Feb 2022, I'm not sure if (1) is still true: 

```
select docid_length,count(*) from(
select length(to_char(docid)) as docid_length from APSD.t_ssb_trip_current@garfo_nefsc where docid is not null) group by docid_length;
```
because the docids are all either 7 (paper) or 14 (electronic) digits 

For (2): you can use the `to_char()` function in oracle sql to force oracle to extract this column as a string. You can leave it as a string or use your statistical software to convert the string back to a number.

### On Home Consumption Fish

> The code for this stuff is BHC_ (either _LIVE_POUNDS or _LANDED_POUNDS).  "BHC" stands for "Bait and Home Consumption".  A few years ago they added LUMF (Legal UnMarketable Fish) to this category as well.  LUMF, at lease for here, and at least as I understand it, is derived from observer trips only.  But I'm not 100% sure on that. If you use DLR_LIVE or DLR_LANDED (or DLR_DOLLAR) you won't get the BHC fish.  If you use LANDED or POUNDS or DOLLAR_SSB/GDP you'll get 'em, plus imputed values for the DOLLAR field. Starting on the next run of DMIS, fish that are authorized to be landed on EFP trips but are not sold thu a dealer will be added to the BHC_ fish.   Chad's email April 11, 2018.

# Versions

> There is a "_current" versioning of tables. As of April 2020, current contains a little bit more data. I now use _trip for everything, whereas a yearly ago I used _current.  There were some discrepancies for earlier years (2013?) that _trip had correct and _trip_current did not.  Otherwise I believe they are the same. (Chad)

> I have been using current since there is more recent data included. Hopefully for older data the two match up, but I haven't looked into that in a while. (Greg)
 
 *UPDATE FROM Sept. 30, 2021: APSD.t_ssb_trip@garfo_nefsc and APSD.t_ssb_catch@garfo_nefsc apparently are no longer in use. Recommend to use the _CURRENT tables. Below is the _CURRENT tables values minus the "NON-CURRENT" values for the full DMIS time period. If pulling exclusively before 2019, then values are similar.

### Price Variables

There are two different price variables within DMIS.

DLR_DOLLAR: The value of landed catch to the nearest dollar, paid to fishermen by the dealer, for a given species. All value from for this variable comes directly from dealer reports.

DOLLAR_SSB: In addition to the values represented in the DLR_DOLLAR variable, DOLLAR_SSB imputs values according to the above code. Imputation is performed in the cases of bait and home consumption (BHC) or if there is a VTR record, but no matching dealer report.
*Greg has some correspondence from Dan Caless that he can forward to anyone interested.

## Completeness of Fishery Revenue data
For many fisheries in the Greater Atlantic Region, DMIS (APSD.t_ssb_catch_current@garfo_nefsc) includes the vast majority of ex-vessel revenues as compared to CFDBS. However, in fisheries which have large state waters components, or unqiue reporting requirements, DMIS may fail to capture a significant portion of revenues. A comparison of fishery ex-vessel revenues in 2018 for the two data sources is provided below. Note lobster and SC/OQ.

# Sample Code
1.  [Code](/code_fragments/DMIS_observer_match.sas) to match observer data to DMIS 
2.  This will get you groundfish trips every time:
```
select XYZ
from APSD.t_ssb_trip_current@garfo_nefsc T, APSD.t_ssb_catch_current@garfo_nefsc C
where C.trip_id=T.trip_id
and C.fishery_group in ('GROUND', 'OTHER2')
and T.groundfish_permit is not null
and T.sector_id <> 2
and C.secgearfish <> 'CAR'
```
