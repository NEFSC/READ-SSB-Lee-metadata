# Social Sciences Branch Metadata
This repository describes data in the NEFSC databases with a special eye towards fields that are used by social scientists.  It is intended as a supplement to the [data dictionary system](https://nova.nefsc.noaa.gov/datadict/). This repository is mostly oracle focused, but there is information on other data sources too.  Sometimes it contains sample code to extract data.

Please help make this a valuable up-to-date resource. This repository is public, but writing to the "master" branch is protected. To contribute, you should either:

1. Create a branch, make your changes, and issue a pull request. Make sure to request a review from someone in SSB that is on the "approving list."
2. Fork this repository to create your own version, make changes, and issue a pull request.

See the instructions in the [How to help](https://github.com/NEFSC/READ-SSB-Lee-WorkingEfficiently) section for more info.


# Basics and General Thoughts

1. Most data are stored in **Oracle databases**, which are located on the "sole" and "NEFSC_USERS" **servers**.  "Nova" was shut down in 2022 and replaced with NEFSC_USERS on NEFSCDB1. 

1. There are various **schema**. Schema are collections of related tables.

1. Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) is often needed as the data are imperfect. 

1.  Many data tables are live, with nightly or continuous updates. For example, when working with the  dealer data, expect approximately 300 changes or additions to the current and previous year of data per day. Data is “complete” 6-9 months after the end of the calendar year; however, small changes are always occurring.
This has consequences for reproducibility if you do not store a copy of the data.

1.  Make sure the table that you're using is not "stale."  Some of the data is stored at GARFO and periodically copied from GARFO to NEFSC servers. Sometimes, they stop getting copied. Sometimes they are updated monthly. One way to check this is to get the maximum DE, DC, or some other date field.

1. Exploring the databases using SQLDeveloper is a good way to build some intuition
    +  In the Connections tab, connect to Sole
    +  Expand the "Other Users" tab.
    +  Expand a schema, like "CFDBS" and explore both "Tables" and "Views" corresponding to that schema.
    

1.  There are tables and there are views.  Sometimes, the sql that generates a view can help you figure out why you're getting an unexplainable result of a query. For example, the following bit of code shows that SECTOR_PARTIPANTS_CPH is based, in part on permit.vps_owner, permit.vps_vessel, and mqrs.mort_elig_criteria.

1.  If you want to use ODBC with R or Stata to read data straight into your software, take a look [here](https://github.com/NEFSC/READ-SSB-Lee-project-template)

1.  It's good practice to include the schema and server when you query data. That is, write:
```
select * from permit.vps_owner@sole
```
instead of 
```
select * from vps_owner
```

1.  There are tables at GARFO that can be queried through a **database link**.  For example, while connected to sole, you can do
```
select * from document@garfo_nefsc 
```
to pull the GARFO "document" table.
